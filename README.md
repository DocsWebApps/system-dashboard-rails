<h1>Welcome to the System Dash Board</h1>

<p><i>Version 1.0 3rd September 2014</i></p>

<p>The System Dashboard is a simple web application developed using Ruby(v2.1.2) on Rails(v4.1.4) that provides a visual dashboard to display the status's of your critical systems to your colleagues, senior managers and customers.</p>

<p>When an incident occurs on a particular system, you enter the details of the fault and the date and time it took place, you then choose a serverity level and commit the information to the database. Immediatley the status of the system in question changes which is then clearly displayed on the dashboard for all to see. Users can then click on a link for that system to see the details of the incident, the details of any workarounds you want to convey to your user community or an estimated time to fix the fault.</p>

<p>It therefore provides a simple but effective way to keep your key stakeholders updated with any problems that your systems or services may be experiencing and what work is being undertaken to restore them.</p>

<p>It also provides you with a facility to receive anonymous feedback from you customers so that you get a better understanding of their needs and problems, feedback you may not get face to face.</p>

<p>An API is being developed to enable web clients to interact with the Dashboard.</p>
